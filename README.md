# Systematic Learning 
## Overview
Repository for my medium post: ["A quick and simple AI-inspired way to learn a language"](https://medium.com/@lucas.soares/a-quick-and-simple-ai-inspired-way-to-learn-a-language-e762754b8a5a) where I talk about an approach for learning a language that leverages concepts from artificial intelligence.

## Setup

### 1. First make sure you have python 3 installed (I tested only with python 3.6.10)
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 2. Install the requirements (run  on terminal)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Modify the dataset.txt file to have the relevant links for your learning goals. (one link per line)

### 4. Run this on terminal
```
python learn_this.py
```

### Final Remark
The data for your learning sessions will be stored in the sessions folder (which will be created when you run the code for the first time)
