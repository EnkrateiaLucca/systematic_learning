# Systematic Learning 
Repository for my medium post: "A quick and simple AI-inspired way to learn a language"

### Quick guide to use this repo

#### 1. First make sure you have python 3 installed (I tested only with python 3.6.10)
https://www.python.org/downloads/

#### 2. Install the requirements (run  on terminal)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### 3. Modify the dataset.txt file to have the relevant links for your learning goals. (one link per line)

#### 4. Run this on terminal

### Final Remark
The data for your learning sessions will be stored in the sessions folder (which will be created when you run the code for the first time)
